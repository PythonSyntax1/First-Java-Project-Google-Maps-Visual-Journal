49.68828596267966=-123.13650804050172=Hike=The trail begins steeply by way of a series of wooden stairs. A lovely stream beckons alongside this section. After the stairs climb on an obvious trail over roots and rocks through what is called South Gully. Keep close to the steep granite wall as you make your way up. Stay left at all intersections to reach First Peak. The other trails lead to Second and Third Peak which are longer and harder hikes. At about the halfway point there is an obvious rock bluff which affords excellent views. Continue hiking. =2019-08-14==Squamish Chief
